[{"content":"Sure! Here\u0026rsquo;s a well-structured and engaging blog post that explains your GitHub project, focusing on integrating force-graph-3d into a Next.js project. The tone is informative and approachable ‚Äî suitable for developers interested in 3D visualization or knowledge graphs.\nIntegrating force-graph-3d into a Next.js Project: A Simple Demo If you\u0026rsquo;re exploring ways to visualize knowledge graphs or network data in 3D using React and Next.js, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably come across the popular library force-graph by @vasturiano. In this post, I‚Äôll walk through how I integrated force-graph-3d ‚Äî its WebGL-based 3D force-directed graph implementation ‚Äî into a Next.js app as part of my ongoing Knowledge Graph + LLM project.\nYou can check out the full code here:\nüëâ GitHub - Knowledge_Graph_X_LLM / graph-visualization\n‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is more of a proof-of-concept/demo than a production-ready solution. There‚Äôs still work to be done before this can scale to large or complex graphs, but it‚Äôs a solid starting point!\nüéØ Why Use force-graph-3d? force-graph-3d offers an interactive and performant way to render large-scale 3D graphs directly in the browser using WebGL. It supports:\nDynamic force simulation Custom node/camera controls Real-time updates Click/touch interactions Since I\u0026rsquo;m working on visualizing knowledge graphs generated via LLMs, having a 3D layout helps users better understand relationships and hierarchies in a visually rich format.\nüõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Next.js Environment I started with a basic create-next-app setup:\n1 npx create-next-app@latest graph-visualization Then installed the required dependencies:\n1 npm install three force-graph-3d üí° force-graph-3d relies on Three.js, so make sure it\u0026rsquo;s included (either directly or as a peer dependency).\nüìê Creating the Graph Component I created a new component called Graph3D.tsx (or .jsx) and imported ForceGraph3D from force-graph-3d.\nHere‚Äôs a simplified version of the component:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 import React, { useEffect, useRef } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import ForceGraph3D from \u0026#39;force-graph-3d\u0026#39;; const Graph3D = () =\u0026gt; { const containerRef = useRef\u0026lt;HTMLDivElement\u0026gt;(null); useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { if (!containerRef.current) return; // Sample graph data const graphData = { nodes: [{ id: \u0026#39;Node A\u0026#39; }, { id: \u0026#39;Node B\u0026#39; }, { id: \u0026#39;Node C\u0026#39; }], links: [ { source: \u0026#39;Node A\u0026#39;, target: \u0026#39;Node B\u0026#39; }, { source: \u0026#39;Node B\u0026#39;, target: \u0026#39;Node C\u0026#39; }, ], }; const Graph = ForceGraph3D(); Graph(containerRef.current) .graphData(graphData) .nodeLabel(\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;) .onNodeClick(node =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;Clicked node:\u0026#39;, node); }); }, []); return \u0026lt;div ref={containerRef} style={{ width: \u0026#39;100%\u0026#39;, height: \u0026#39;80vh\u0026#39; }} /\u0026gt;; }; export default Graph3D; This will render a simple 3D force-directed graph inside a div.\nüß™ Running the App After creating the component, I imported and rendered it in the main page (pages/index.tsx):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import React from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import Graph3D from \u0026#39;../components/Graph3D\u0026#39;; export default function Home() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;3D Graph Visualization with Next.js\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Graph3D /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Now run the dev server:\n1 npm run dev Visit http://localhost:3000, and you should see an interactive 3D graph spinning in space!\nüì∑ Exapmple screenshot: üß© Challenges and Considerations 1. Hydration Issues in Next.js Because force-graph-3d creates DOM elements outside of React, you might run into hydration mismatches when using SSR. To avoid this, I conditionally render the graph only after mounting on the client side.\n2. Performance \u0026amp; Scalability Rendering hundreds or thousands of nodes can get heavy quickly. Optimization techniques like throttling force simulation steps or limiting node rendering radius may be necessary.\n3. TypeScript Support The current example uses JavaScript, but if you\u0026rsquo;re using TypeScript, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to define types for nodes and links manually or use declaration files.\nüå± What‚Äôs Next? This demo serves as a foundation for building more advanced visualizations. Some ideas for future improvements include:\nConnecting the graph to real LLM-generated knowledge triples Adding tooltip support on hover Enhancing styling with labels, colors, and icons Supporting zoom/pan interaction customization Improving accessibility and responsiveness üßæ Conclusion Integrating force-graph-3d into a Next.js project isn\u0026rsquo;t too difficult once you navigate around some SSR quirks. With just a few lines of code, you can start rendering beautiful and interactive 3D graphs right in your React application.\nAs part of my larger Knowledge Graph + LLM project, this visualization layer opens up exciting possibilities for understanding and navigating complex semantic relationships.\nLet me know if you try this out or have suggestions for improvements!\nüîó Links üì¶ GitHub Repo: https://github.com/gwzz/Knowledge_Graph_X_LLM/tree/main/visulization/graph-visualization üìö force-graph-3d: https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph üöÄ Next.js Docs: https://nextjs.org/docs ","date":"2025-07-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://gwzz.github.io/p/graph-visualization/graph-fg3_hu_eee5e39a013fc133.png","permalink":"https://gwzz.github.io/p/graph-visualization/","title":"Graph Visualization"},{"content":"Exploring LLM Training and Finetuning with My New Project In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone for various natural language processing tasks. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s chatbots, content generation, translation, or sentiment analysis, LLMs are at the heart of many modern applications.\nToday, I\u0026rsquo;m excited to introduce my new GitHub project: LLM_training_and_finetune ‚Äî a repository dedicated to exploring the training and fine-tuning of powerful language models.\nWhat is This Project About? The LLM_training_and_finetune project aims to provide a hands-on guide and set of tools for training and customizing large language models.

Fine-tuning strategies for adapting pre-trained models to specific use cases. Support for various frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and more. Documentation and examples to help users get started quickly. Why This Matters As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the ability to tailor these models to fit specific domains or languages becomes increasingly important. By sharing this project, I hope to contribute to the growing community of developers and researchers who are pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with LLMs.\nGetting Started If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in exploring how to train or fine-tune language models, here\u0026rsquo;s how you can get started:\nClone the Repository:\n1 git clone https://github.com/gwzz/LLM_training_and_finetune.git Explore the Folder Structure:\nThe repository includes detailed directories for datasets, training scripts, configuration files, and documentation.\nFollow the Instructions:\nCheck out the README file for setup instructions, dependencies, and example workflows.\nContribute or Ask Questions:\nFeel free to open issues or pull requests if you\u0026rsquo;d like to contribute or need help understanding any part of the code.\nRoadmap This project is still in its early stages, but I plan to expand it significantly over time:\nAdding support for distributed training across multiple GPUs. Incorporating evaluation metrics and benchmarking tools. Providing tutorials on domain-specific fine-tuning (e.g., medical, legal, finance). Sharing insights and best practices learned during experimentation. Final Thoughts Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, I invite you to explore LLM_training_and_finetune and join me in uncovering the potential of large language models.
